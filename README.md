**Bookstore Application (WPF)**  
This project is a WPF application connected to a database for managing inventory and books in a bookstore. The application allows users to view inventory levels in different stores, add and remove books and authors, and manage the book catalog by editing titles and author details. The project was developed in collaboration with my classmate  Lovisa Renman (https://github.com/LovisaRenman/Bookstore).

This project reflects what I have learned in the course "Utveckling mot databas och databasadministration", particularly the concepts up to the topics of Entity Framework. Please note that the application is still a work in progress, and there are areas that could be further improved.

* **View Inventory**: Users can list the inventory levels of books in various stores.
* **Add and Remove Books**: Users can add books to store inventories and remove them.
